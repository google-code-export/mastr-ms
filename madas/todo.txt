1. Existing:        Responses when things went wrong?:
                    e.g. couldnt delete/create/rename group, etc. User sees no errors
2. FIXED            Cant click on 'this dialog will auto close in...' type popups. Have to wait. :(
3. FIXED            Django not expiring sessions? Auto logout feature not working
4. FIXED:           Email notification
5. FIXED:           User password changing
6. FIXED:           Forgot password stuff
7. IMPROVEMENT:     Change default pw encoding to MD5 - make configurable in settings.py
8. FIXED:           Code in 'update user' to change username, ensure group membership etc.
9.                  Trying to delete 'system' nodes like 'Don't know'. What happens? : May need code later to update quotes in the DB when a node rename happens.
10. FIXED:          Caching of groups / 'credentials' in MadasUser model
12. FIXED(4/4):     quote save (DONE), quote history (DONE), forward request, send formal quote...
11. FIXED(3/3):quote/formalload, formal accept, formal reject
13.                 quote:load - mark quote if read if not already
14.                 are email addresses in Emailmap unique? Can multiple id's exist for the one email address? If so, quote:_getEmailMapping is broken
15. FIXED (boro)    'completed' checkbox missing off quote request detail form. Interacting with the checkbox probably does nothing too.
16. FIXED            downloadAttachment doesnt seem to work yet
17. FIXED:  quote/listFormal is COMPLETELY broken (showing history entries in the main list 'details')
18. FIXED:           what are these for, where are they used, and why: 
                        def getNodeMemberships(request, groups):
                        def get_madas_user_groups(username, include_status_groups = False):
19. NEEDS           'Dont KNow'  list restricted groups isnt working. Drill into a quote, click 'forward request', and click the dropdown. Meant to see nodes, currently seeing nothing.
20. EXISTING BUG:   losing quote request details. Drill into a quote, click 'forward request', click 'cancel edit', and now your quote form is blank.
21. FIXED:          email adderess missing on quote request 'detail' page
22. FIXED:          updating users does not update their group information. Suggest writing an explicit method for this, doing it after a user details update (_usersave)
23. FIXED:          also, since changing groups isnt supported, there is no way to trigger an email on this event.
24. FIXED           After editing a user, (admin or otherwise), the user details arent reloaded. Need a mainContentFunction set.
25. FIXED           This type of stuff is happening on front page:
                        authorize: destination was  {{ mainContentFunction }}
                        Seems to be calling a page like this: [28/May/2009 14:07:58] "POST /%7B%7B%20mainContentFunction%20%7D%7D/authorize HTTP/1.1" 200 267
26. EXISTING:       Can't 'cancel' on Quotes Request (Make and Inquiry)
27. FIXED:          List Quotes: get different list to nick's
28. FIXED (boro)    favicon
29: FIXED:          Edit User not working properly. Not saving node membership, not showing checkboxes
30: FIXED:          Edit user should go back to previous page once edited (admin:active users)
31: FIXED:          Everyone seeing 'admin' tag - everyone has 'is_staff' set.
32: FIXED (acceptable): Maybe a bug: non admin (node rep only) tries to edit someone elses record, doesn't get a 'you cant do that' message.
33. FIXED:          formalLoad: need to load a bunch of user details (refer to original PHP function).
34: FIXED:          Formalquote detail: Current PDF not showing.
35: FIXED:          'Details' column not showing up in 'my formal quotes'
36: FIXED:          'Download quote pDF' button doesnt work on Formal Quote detail page
37: FIXED           emailing of the node rep in quote.save is not done.
38:                 The 'Dont Know' debacle: Dont know needs to be an option on node reps 'forward to' dropdowns, and also when Admins look at their 'auxillary' node - is this where 'don't know' quotes go? Need to make sure that it is.
39:                 NOTE: Make sure all public facing URLS are going through an 'authorize' step.
40: FIXED:          Nodereps should only see active users in their own node.
41:                 Make an Inquiry: Send Request To should populate.
42.                 Do something once your session has timed out and you get shown a 'not authorized page', but all your links are still available. Needs to redirect to login.
43.                 Reject Formal still works after a session timeout.
44. IMPROVEMENT:    Make ldap_get_user_details return a user details dict and a groups list as a tuple. Saves having groups polluting the user details, and having to clear out this attribute before writing altered details back. Also makes API a lot cleaner.
45.                 ldap code does not delete 'pager' attribute of users when updating their password. It should at least clear it.
46:                 external links to quotes do not work for logged in users - it requires them to login again. Fix doesn't seem too hard.
47:                 _findAdminOrNodeRepEmailTarget seems to be always choosing sdayalan@cs.rmit.edu.au for nodes like Murdoch Uni or Don't Know. The ordering might be wrong - I might need to be pulling a Node Rep first and *then* an admin
48:                 the dreaded 'n'. logging in is NOT taking the user to the correct view!! They get the login screen with extra options up the top :(. The request is to siteurl/n/authorise. Seems like a params/response problem.
49:                 Create a new node with no members and attempt to forward a quote to that node. _findAdminOrNodeRepEmailTarget borks at a list index exception

FUNCTIONALITY 
0. Send request. Doesnt do everything it is supposed to.
1. DONE: Formal Save (see bug 12)
2. DONE: Formal accept/reject (see bug 13)
3. DONE: Attach file to formal quote
4. DONE: Attach file to quote enquiry
5. DONE: Download quote attachment (quote request details)
6. DONE: Download formal quote attachment. (My Formal Quotes->drill, Download quote pdf)
7. DONE: Clicking links from email
8. DONE: Forgot pasword.
9. DONE: Need a SITEURL/SECURE SITE URL for email links, etc.
10. DONE: Users that arent admins shouldnt be able to change their node. Or make themselves an admin!


Notes:
0. Users are only notified of an account change if it involves the status - they won't be told if they change nodes or have some other change made. Users made active or rejected are notified specially, but users moved to pending or deleted just get a generic account modification email.
1. Forgot Password: the submit button gives no feedback.
2. It looks like on the 'Save Details and Accept Quote that you could change someones details. Anyones.
3. The code assumes usernames are email addresses, which is the convention, but may not always be so. At some point it would be good to always look up the 'mail' property of the user based on their uid.

DEPLOY TODO:
db needs sequences changed
django part needs 'madas' group created
if you don't move the data (pdfs/attachments) across, you will get broken downloads
