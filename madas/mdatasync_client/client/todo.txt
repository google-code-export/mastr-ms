1. Install on windows, when you run rsync for the first time it asks if you want to 'unblock' it. A user can probably click on the dialogue, but it would be good if there was a way to automatically fix this.
2. Rsync on unix (probably windows too) wants hosts authed for knownhosts file. Prompt for 'yes/no' answer, and then for passphrase :(
3. The remote file structure needs to exist. The remote rsync fails if the path to the remote dump location isn't completely created first.
    The remote side needed syncdir/org/sitename created. It seemed happy to create installationmame/* itself.
4. Dealing with errors on the gui client - popup a window? Have obvious ways of fixing errors, with a 'make it all better' button?


INSTALLER
----------
Needs to install:
python
wx
cwrsync (ssh?)   #"cwrsync_install.exe /S" for silent mode works beautifully.
the ssh private keys
the app code.
