Quotes System
=============

One of the components of Mastr-MS is a system for clients to submit requests for quotes on work they would like done. This is accessible from the menu, whether the user is logged in or not. This means people can submit requests for quotes without needing to be a member of the site.

When a quote is requested, the user provides an email address and some contact details, and choose a node to send it to. They also have an option to send to "Don't Know". Lastly, users have a space to describe the type of work they need done and the requirements, and attach a file if required.

Behind The Scenes
=================

When a quote is requested, an email is sent to the nodereps assigned to the node they have directed the quote to. If "Don't Know" was chosen in the form, then the site admins are notified instead.
